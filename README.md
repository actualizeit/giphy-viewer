# Da Best Staw Was Game Evah!

Have you ever wanted to see what random people on the internet have turned into memes from your favorite video games? Well now's your chance. Just click one of the prepopulated buttons and you'll get 10 of the dankest gif memes the whole planet can think up, specific to your video game of choice. Or really anything else if you add a button for it.

## Getting Started

Pick a button from the list or type your own into the text field and it will add a button that will retrieve gifs for that search term from giphy (tm) (praise be). Each time a button is clicked 10 items are added to the page, which can be started and stopped by clicking on them (once to start, again to stop).

Once you're all gifed out, hit the clear gifs button to remove all of the gifs and let you see that adorable space (marine?) cat again. And who wouldn't want that?

### Prerequisites

This game requires an internet connection and browser such as Chrome, Firefox or IE I guess if you're into that kinda thing.

### Installing

No installation necessary, this thing runs in the browser!

## Running the tests
